# BrainBloom App

**BrainBloom** is an AI-powered mental health companion designed to nurture emotional well-being through instant, intelligent, and compassionate support.

## ðŸŒ¸ What Is BrainBloom?
**BrainBloom** is a modular, AI-driven mental wellness system designed to cultivate emotional resilience and well-being. It orchestrates a collaborative team of intelligent agentsâ€”each specializing in a key aspect of mental health support.</br>

### The system is designed to:

- Identify emotional states and assess risk in real-time based on user inputs.
- Automate triage and intelligent escalation for high-risk situations, connecting users to urgent care when necessary.
- Recommend tailored self-care resources and support options that match individual needs and contexts.
- Facilitate empathetic, ongoing dialogue to nurture mental clarity and emotional growth.
- Integrate with external APIs and data sources to deliver current, relevant, and diverse support services.

ðŸŒ¿ We currently use **Bolt** to rapidly prototype our multi-agent architecture. This prototype serves as a foundational platform for efficiently deploying agents that will interface with our backend multi-AI model infrastructure.
